# Preface {.unnumbered}

These are class notes for a quarter long course on *Introduction to Optimization* (Math 368) at Northwestern University taught during the Winter and Spring of 2022. The class is aimed at upper-level undergrads who've completed a basic sequence in linear algebra and calculus. The prerequisites for the linear programming part are Gaussian elimination and basic theorem proving. For the non-linear programming part, you'll need to know basic properties of gradients and directional derivatives.

The textbook used in the class was *Linear Programming, Foundations and Extensions*, by Robert J. Vanderbei. The textbook is freely available to Northwestern students via [SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4614-7630-6). The textbook was used mainly as a reference for examples and exercises.
