These are the class notes for a quarter long course I taught at Northwestern University in Winter and Spring 2022. 
The notes only cover the theoretical aspect of the course. Students were also assigned weekly worksheets to solve using the SOLVER add-in for Excel.

Any suggestions and improvements to the notes are welcome and greatly appreciated.
