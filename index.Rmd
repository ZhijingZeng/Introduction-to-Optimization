# Preface {.unnumbered}

These are the class notes for a quarter long course I taught at Northwestern University in Winter and Spring 2022. The topics include:

-  Linear programming
    -  Simplex method
    -  Duality theory
-  Non-linear programming
    -  KKT conditions
    -  Interior point methods
-  Applications
    -  Network flow
    -  $L^1$-regression

These notes only cover the theoretical aspect of the course. Students were also assigned weekly worksheets to solve using the SOLVER add-in for Excel. These worksheets were an integral part of the learning experience. Some of these can be found in the Github repository and several more are available in the references.
