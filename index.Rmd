# Preface {.unnumbered}

These are class notes for a quarter long course on *Introduction to Optimization* (Math 368) at Northwestern University taught during the Winter and Spring of 2022. 
For the most part, these notes talk about linear programming and duality theory, and only towards the very end we discuss non-linear programming.
The class is aimed at upper-level undergrads who've completed a basic sequence in
linear algebra and calculus.
The prerequisites for the linear programming part are Gaussian elimination and basic theorem proving.
For the non-linear programming part, you'll need to know basic properties of gradients and directional derivatives.
