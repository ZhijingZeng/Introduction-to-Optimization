# Introduction-to-Optimization

These are the class notes for a quarter long course I taught at Northwestern University in Winter and Spring 2022.

Please feel free to fork and modify the Github repo or use these notes as-is.
Any suggestions and improvements to the notes are welcome and greatly appreciated. 
You can [send me an email](mailto:apurva.nakade@northwestern.edu) or [open an issue](https://github.com/apurvanakade/Introduction-to-Optimization/issues) on Github. 

The notes are written in Rmarkdown using the [bookdown package](https://bookdown.org/home/).  
See the instructions [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/get-started.html) for installing bookdown.
The easiest way to compile these notes from scratch is to clone the repo and open the `.Proj` file in Rstudio.
Use Rstudio's "Build Book" command (can be found under "Build") to generate either `.html`or `.pdf` files.
